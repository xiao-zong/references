@article{luczak06,
	abstract = {Abstract For 0 < p < 1 and q > 0 let Gq(n,p) denote the random graph with vertex set [n]={1,{\ldots},n} such that, for each graph G on [n] with e(G) edges and c(G) components, the probability that Gq(n,p)=G is proportional to \$p^{e(G)}(1-p)^{({n \atop 2})-e(G)}q^{c(G)}\$. The first systematic study of Gq(n,p) was undertaken by Bollob{\'a}s, Grimmett, and Janson (Probab Theory Relat Fields 104 (1996), 283--317), who analyzed the phase transition phenomenon corresponding to the emergence of the giant component. In this paper we describe the structure of Gq(n,p) very close the critical threshold. {\copyright} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct. Alg., 2006},
